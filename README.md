## Hello

I currently work on 
- an IoT Platform, which you can find at <https://lab5e.com>.
- Developing software for Onboard Units (OBU), including backends, PKI systems, embedded software

If you have questions relating to consulting gigs, please email me 

Most of my work is done in Go.  I occasionally write a bit of firmware in C.  I try to avoid C++. I'm Rust curious.
